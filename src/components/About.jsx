      <p>
      Hi! I'm Tushar Pareek, a passionate MERN Stack Developer and a Computer Science Engineering student at Global Institute of Technology, Jaipur (Batch: 2022–2026).

I love turning ideas into reality through code. Over the past months, I’ve built multiple projects like a Mala Counter, a Weather Dashboard, and a Tic-Tac-Toe Game using React. I also interned at Zeetron Networks Pvt. Ltd., where I gained hands-on experience in real-world development.

Besides coding, I’m a national-level Judo player, and I enjoy vlogging, singing, playing football and reading. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy exploring new technologies that help improve user experiences.

I'm currently working on improving my React skills, learning better component structuring, CSS Modules.
